Problem Sheet 5Problem 1. Let   X1   , . . . ,   Xn   be   iid   copies   of   a   random   variable   X   ~ N   (θ,   σ2)   and suppose that the   prior   distribution   of the   mean   θ   is   N   (µ,   τ2).      The   parameters   σ2,   µ   and   τ2 are   known.1.   Find   the   joint   pdf   of   X   and   θ   .2.      Show   that   m(xjσ2,   µ,   τ2), the   marginal   distribution   of   X, is   N   (µ,   σ2   /n   +   τ2).3.    Show   that   π(θjx,   σ2,   µ,   τ2),   the   posterior   distribution   of   θ,   is   normal   with mean   and   variance   given   by 

Problem 2. Let   X1   ; . . . ;   Xn      be   iid   copies   of   a   random   variable   X   ~   Poisson(λ)   and   suppose   that   the   prior   distribution   of   λ   is   gamma(Q;   β).

Problem 3. Consider   the   so   called   LINEX   loss   function   given   by

where   c   is   a   positive   constant. 
1.    For   c   =   .2, .5, 1,   plot   L(θ,   a)   as   a   function   of   a - θ   .
2.   If   X   ~   Pθ(x),   show   that   the   Bayes   estimator   (or   Bayes   rule)   of   θ,   using   a   prior α,   is   given   by

3.    Let   X1   , . . . ,   Xn    be   iid   N(θ,   σ2),   where   σ2 is   known,   and   suppose   that   θ   has   the noninformative prior Q(θ) =   1. Show that the   Bayes   estimator   (or   Bayes   rule)   is   given   by   δB(X) = X - (cσ2/(2n)).
4.    Calculate the posterior expected loss   for   δB(X)   and X-   using   the   LINEX   loss   function.
5.    Calculate   the   posterior   expected   loss   for   δB(X)   and   X-   using   squared   error   loss.
